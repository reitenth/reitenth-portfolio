title: Introducing Portfolio
slug: astro-1-0-release-update
excerpt: This is the first blog post on my new website I made using Astro. I primarily made it as a portfolio to show off my work and what I have learned. I am not sure how often I will write blog posts, but I will keep the projects updated with my most prevelant work. This is the first time I have coded anything outside of basic HTML and CSS (which is all this site is with a little JS included) so somethings might be a little off, but I plan to keep working on my skills to make more advanced work instead of a static site. That is about all I have to share right now. Thanks for stopping by!
